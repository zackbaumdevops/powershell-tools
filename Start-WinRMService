# This function was specifically implemented to invoke WMI objects incompatible with future versions of Powershell Core 5+
# which are incompatible with WMI objects commonly utilized in Windows Powershell 5.1. This function shortcuts this issue
# by passing the WmiObject command through as a Base64 string and then executes it within a Windows Powershell 5.1 window
# and can be invoked against a ComputerNames (string array). Calling the service in the typical manner against a remote session
# using Powershell Core is normally impossible due to its inability to remotely call the service's WMI properties.
